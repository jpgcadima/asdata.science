Hi Sinead,

I went to see the flights and I am having some logistic issues. May I have your help to make some changes with the scheduling?

Is the hangouts meeting done inside the google HQ? Or will I do it after leaving the HQ? 
On the 26th the last flight from Dublin to Lisbon is at 6.45pm (Aer Lingus) so I would lose the flight with the hangouts interview, on the other hand to be at 2.15pm at the google facilities will also be a challenge if I take the first flight (it arrives in Dublin at 12.50pm but as an average delay of 30min)

My suggestion would be to have the hangouts call to the US the day before, on the 25th. This way I could return to Lisbon after the last onsite interview on the 26th. Another option I can think of is to move the onsite interviews to the 25th as well but change the time slots from 4pm to 6pm so I can arrive in time after the flight (plus eating something).

Summarizing some options:
Hangouts 7.15pm-8pm on the 25th and onsite 2.15pm-4pm on the 26th.
Onsite 4.15pm to 6pm on the 25th and hangouts 7.15pm-8pm on the 25th.

Or if there are some problems with the previous options I would do a suggestion for the next week (any day after the 31th):
Hangouts 7.15pm-8pm on the 31th and onsite 2.15pm-4pm on the 1st of August.
Onsite 4.15pm to 6pm on the 1st of August and hangouts 7.15pm-8pm on the 1st of August.

I tried to find the most simple options, but if you have any suggestions feel free to suggest it.
Thank you so much for your help!
