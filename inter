Hi Sinead,
Just saw the flight schedules and would appreciate your help making some changes as I need to came back to Lisbon by the end of the 26th and the last flight is at 6.45pm.

Furthermore the first flight I found from Lisbon to Dublin arrives at 12.50pm. with an average of 30min delay. Having this restrictions, I would suggest to change the hangouts call with Blazej to another day, say the 25th, so that I can return to Lisbon after the onsite interview in the 26th (2.15pm to 4pm) and arrive in Dublin in the 25th. 

Another option I can think of is to move both interviews to the 25th, having the onsite interview from 4pm to 6pm so I can arrive on time after the flight and hopefully eat something on the way.

Alternatively, if there are any problems with the timeslots suggested for those dates, taking into account the 12.50pm earliest arrival and the 6.45pm last flight, we could try for a solution in the week after (from the 31th of July to the 3 of August). Feel free to suggest a day that works 

Thank you
