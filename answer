Hi Kotryna!

Thank you very much for noticing my profile for this vacancy.

I am working right now in the banking sector as a data scientist and the oportunity to go to Berlin for a Leading Fintech company seems really exciting.

How urgent is to fill that vacancy right now? Unfortenatly I am going to be quite busy until January and I would only be available afterwards.
Because of my timing restraints I understand that might be a problem, but I can send you my CV and we can have a call, if not this one, other vacancies that you would find interesting.


Thank you very much,
